  	<p> Use a different password for each of your important accounts, like your email and online banking accounts.<p/>

  <h2>Use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols in your password:</h2>

	<h2> Don't use personal information or common words as a password:</h2>
	<br>
		<div>
		<p>Create a unique password that's unrelated to your personal information and uses a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. Don't use simple words or phrases like "password" or "letmein," keyboard patterns such as "qwerty" or "qazwsx," or sequential patterns such as "abcd1234" which make your password easier to guess.

	<h2>Make sure your backup password options are up-to-date and secure:</h2>
		<p>Update your recovery email address regularly so that you can receive emails in case you need to reset your password. You can also add a recovery phone number to receive password reset codes via text message.

	<div class="box">

	<h2>Keep your passwords secure:</h2>
	<br>
		<div>
		<p>Don't leave notes with your passwords to various sites on your computer or desk, where people can easily steal them and use them to compromise your accounts. If you choose to save passwords in a file on your computer, create a name for the file that won't give it away. If you have a difficult time remembering multiple passwords, use a trusted password manager. Be sure to spend a few minutes checking out reviews and reputations of password manager services.
